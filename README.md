README for libmad.js
========================

In order to build libmad.js, make sure you have emscripten installed.
Then simply run "make", and the build process will download the lame
source file, extract it, and build the JavaScript version of libmad.

Alternatively, the dist subdirectory contains a minified, ready-to-use version 
of libmad.js.
